## Description
Chinese zodiac animals have lucky meanings. Chinese people associate each animal with certain characteristics. It's believed that people born in a given year have the personality of that year's animal. Click
the animal signs below to learn more about each zodiac animal.The 12 animals were chosen deliberately, after many revisions. The zodiac animals are either closely related to ancient
 Chinese people's daily lives, or have lucky meanings.Chinese zodiac uses the principles of yin and yang. Since the zodiac animal cycle of 12 is divisible by two, every zodiac sign
 can occur only as either Yin or Yang.
